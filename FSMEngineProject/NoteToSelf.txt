This project uses the OpenAL-Soft implmenetation that was obtained using VCPKG.
Both the debug and releae DLLs are the x64 versions (despite the '32' in their name)


I already know myself in the future will have forgotten which version of OpenAL
is in use here and may screw things up by bringing in files from the wrong version.

As of me writing this note in April 2019, there are at least 2 versions of OpenAL on
my computer. The one currently in use in this solution is what is known as the OpenAL-Light 
implementation, and 100% of the data and files for it originated from VCPKG. Be aware that
this implementation is LGPL licensed, so please please please do NOT static link this 
library into the executable, it should always be loaded as a DLL. 


There is also a second OpenAL implementation located in c/[me]/documents/OpenAL.
This one claims to install the OpenAL SDK that comes with a usable OpenAL DLL, but I have 
been unable to locate the DLL. It also comes with some interesting-looking audio effects.

To keep things from getting mixed up, only the VCPKG version of OpenAL is in use in this
project.
