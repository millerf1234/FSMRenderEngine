//  File:             DefaultValuesForFSMEngine.h
//
//  TL;DR             This file is meant to serve as a fall-back collection of 
//                    reasonable values that are to be used for choosing an appropriate 
//                    value to use for each setting. This way in the event that a setting 
//                    encounters an issue loading, there is a replacement setting available 
//                    to take its place. 
//                    
//  Intention:        My hope is that these constant values remain mostly stagnant for development 
//                    so that this file can safely be widely included across many of the other files
//                    without wasting to much time through causing the need for constant recompiling. 
//                    Please update settings using the file-system as much as possible!
